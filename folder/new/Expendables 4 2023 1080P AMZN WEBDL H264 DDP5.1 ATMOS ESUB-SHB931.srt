1
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:12,681
Omar, what's the status
on the general?

2
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:19,470
No?

3
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:30,960
Hamza.

4
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,824
Where is General Fezzan?

5
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,175
Tell me.

00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:07,143

18
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,732
I might be complicated,
but I ain't fucking hopeless.

19
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:17,082
Is that what we call it?
Complicated?

20
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:20,042
Well, whatever it's called,
it's not working, is it?

21
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,001
Come on, Gina,
you're not looking
at the big picture.

22
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,307
What's the big picture?

23
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,657
Is it you?
Are you my big picture?

24
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,093
Oh, my God, thank you.

25
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,617
You should get
the fuck over yourself.

26
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:30,444
'‘Cause you know what
you actually are?

27
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,575
A caveman.

28
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,709
You do resemble a caveman.
You know what it is?

29
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,580
- And you don't?
- You don't want competition.

30
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,974
- Gina, please, calm down.
- That's what
your problem is.

31
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:41,063
Me calm down?
Did you just tell me--

32
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,239
Don't tell me
to fucking calm down!
I'm calm!

33
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,850
I've never been
more fucking calm in my life.

34
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,505
"Oh, look at me.

35
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,552
I'm English. I'm avoidant.
I don't like to argue."

36
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,293
Well, guess what?

37
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,904
I just want a little peace
in my life. Right?

38
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,471
- It'd be nice.
- I'm from America, bitch.
We're gonna fight about it.

39
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,560
- Go. Just go. Go.
- So what does that make me?

40
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,865
Does that make me stressful?

41
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,432
No, no, no.

42
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,174
A little violent perhaps.

43
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,264
I'm a professional.

44
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,961
Yeah. And a little violent.

45
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,093
A little bit.

46
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,529
Teeny bit.

47
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,965
You know what it is?

48
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,967
I've got your skills
and then some.

49
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,579
And neither of you like it
because you're both cavemen.

50
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,364
She's talking to you.

51
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,105
Actually, she's looking
in your direction.

52
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:25,020
- I'm talking to you.
-  Mm-hmm.

53
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,369
But about you.

54
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,502
You might be my boss,

55
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,069
but I can tell that
you're also from this planet
called "hopeless"

56
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,376
where intimate relationships
and feelings

57
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,726
don't fucking exist!

58
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,599
Fucking baby.
I've wasted so much
of my life on you.

59
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,905
You are a loser.
But I like you.

60
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:44,344
- Thanks.
- Why are you here?

61
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,912
I lost my ring at this bar,
and I need you to--

62
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:51,438
I'm sorry. Is that it?
Are we done talking?

63
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,353
Are you done
with this conversation?

64
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,224
Conversation?

65
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,792
It's more like
angry chatter.

66
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:58,836
Fuck you.

67
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,709
She's talking to you again.

68
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,713
- It's depressing.
- No. It's okay.

69
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,462
I liked her, Barney.

70
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,683
She's an Expendable, Christmas.

71
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:23,383
Look, I got great respect
for your uncanny abilities.
I really do.

72
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,734
But you are a selfish prick.

73
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,344
- Really?
- We all are.

74
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,520
We have to be
to choose this life

75
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,261
over friends, over family.

76
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,915
We do this for money.

77
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,701
- That's the definition
of prickism.

78
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,442
What do you think
of my analysis?

79
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,530
Pretty good?

80
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,707
I think you're a moron.

81
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,100
You don't believe that.

82
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,407
With every cell in my body.

83
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,105
Why are we here?

84
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:53,717
I lost my ring last night
in a bet, and I'm here
to try to buy it back.

85
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:54,805
Seriously?

86
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:55,893
Yeah, seriously.

87
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,286
A silly little trinket.

88
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,116
I'm superstitious about it,
and I like it.

89
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,900
Feel like
I'm missing a finger.

90
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,732
I tried getting it back,
but this half-ass
won't negotiate.

91
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,821
- Who?
- Jumbo Shrimp.

92
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,127
- Who's he?
- You'll see.

93
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,782
- What's up, Barney?
- Hey, Billy.

94
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:21,005
So how'd you lose
your most prized possession?

95
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:23,878
Thumb wrestling.

96
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,358
- You mean arm wrestling?
- No.

97
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,708
I mean thumb wrestling.

98
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,797
Like that.
Give me your hand.

99
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,407
No. Thumb wrestling?

100
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:33,888
You used to be strong.
What happened?

101
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,630
And you used to be hairy.
What happened?

102
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,501
Things change.

103
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,850
- What's up, Barney?
- Hey, how you doing?

104
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,286
Jumbo Shrimp around?

105
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,245
Is there a problem?

106
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,769
- My friend
wants his ring back.
-  Mm-hmm.

107
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,207
Bet's a bet, man.

108
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,253
You know, no offense,
but I'm missing my ring.

109
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,472
It stays where it is.

110
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,912
That's unacceptable.

111
00:07:58,608 --> 00:07:59,957
Striking resemblance.

112
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:03,526
That's brutal.

113
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,575
- These the guys, Barney?
- Yeah.

114
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,620
Now I see
why they call him Jumbo.

115
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,667
- No, the other guy, second guy.
-  Oh.

116
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,148
You lost
to Santa's helper?

117
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,542
That's embarrassing.

118
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,804
I was drunk.

119
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,937
Well, you're not drunk now.

120
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,199
Why the fuck am I here?

121
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,507
I hurt my back.

122
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,639
Since when?

123
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,859
A few weeks ago.
I can't even lift a fork.

124
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,469
I would do it for you.
But if you don't want
to do it, I understand.

125
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,731
If you're intimidated...

126
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:35,819
Intimidated?

127
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,560
Hey, Lee.

128
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,431
Make it easy on yourself.

129
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:41,738
The classics.

130
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,175
I got this, Thumbo.

131
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:46,134
Beer, please.

132
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,441
How you doing this nice day?

133
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,970
What do you prefer
to be called,
"Jumbo" or "Shrimp"?

134
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,064
Call me that again.

135
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,893
Cut your fucking head off.

136
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:09,549
That's a little harsh,
bite-size.

137
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,507
Barney wants his ring back.

138
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,552
What did you call me?

139
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,163
How much for it back, Yoda?

140
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,730
Hey!

141
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,558
It stays here, asshole.

142
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,781
My back.

143
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,091
You see,

144
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:33,224
what we have here
is a matter of humiliation
and human kindness.

145
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:37,141
My friend here loves his ring
for all of his stupid reasons.

146
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,013
And it would be very nice
and civilized

147
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,450
if you gents would
understand that principle.

148
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,278
But since you choose to be--

149
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,368
- Barney, what's the word?
- Obstinate.

150
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,456
Too long.

151
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,197
Dumbbells.

152
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,199
Dumbbells.

153
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:54,855
You leave me no other choice, dinky.

154
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,390
- You're welcome.
- You're slowing down.

155
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,915
My turn, bitch.

156
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,879
Come on, chuck.
Come on, cowboy. Bring it.

157
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,845
Get him a beer
when he wakes up.

158
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,895
You almost killed me.

159
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,376
I thought you had a bad back.

160
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,901
You know, it's a miracle.
It just went away.

161
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:44,295
You know, I really didn't need
this lovefest.

162
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,820
I like spending time
with you.

163
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:52,303
Next time,
take me on a pony ride, okay?

164
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,874
Okay.

165
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,588
Overwatch, what is the status?

166
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,898
Sir, there are three soldiers
guarding the general.

167
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,204
<i>You're gonna need backup.</i>

168
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,206
<i>I repeat, wait for backup.</i>

169
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,561
What the fuck is he doing?

170
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,519
No, no, no.
No, no, please. Please, don't.

171
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,897
What's up, General?

172
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,909
- Are my eyes deceiving me?
- Why?

173
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,955
What's that thing
on Gunner's head?

174
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,740
It looks like a sick cat.

175
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,394
Cats are cute.

176
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,875
That looks like tumbleweed.

177
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,922
- Hey, good evening, big man.

178
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,141
Let's talk.
What's that thing
on your head?

179
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,448
Oh, the wig?

180
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,798
- Yeah, the wig.
- Question is, why?

181
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,844
Well, I was chatting
with this girl on the Internet

182
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,933
and she likes
that '70s look, you know.

183
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,151
The Farrah Fawcett thing.

184
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,371
Got it. You met her yet?

185
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,504
Why-- Why would I do that?
I like the mystery.

186
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,332
Understand?
Yeah, that makes sense.

187
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,899
- Sounds special.
- It does.

188
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,771
I liked him better
when he was a drunk.

189
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,076
I know what you mean.
Me too.

190
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,425
I'm happy for you.

191
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,301
Hey, is this the new guy?

192
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,347
Hey, it's Easy Day.

193
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,262
Good man. Ex-special forces.

194
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,395
- Hey, Barney.
- Hey, Easy.

195
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,224
This our sniper?

196
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:13,531
Don't worry about it.
I got a prescription scope.

197
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,533
What?

198
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,274
Well, Hawkeyes,
remember this face.

199
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,754
Don't shoot it by accident.

200
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,844
You don't have to worry
about me.

201
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:22,976
Who's this guy?

202
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,673
You're slipping, pal.

203
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,675
You hired him.
That's Galgo's son.

204
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,983
I have the eyesight,
the heart and the sex drive
of my father.

205
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,767
Tell me he doesn't talk
as much as his father.

206
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,203
- He's worse.
- No.

207
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,465
Twice as bad.

208
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,945
It's gonna be a long trip.

209
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,556
I am Galan.

210
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,994
That suppose
to mean something?

211
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,302
It's supposed to mean
a little something.

212
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,870
All right,
cut the bullshit.
All eyes on me.

213
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,958
Who's the suit?

214
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,178
His name is Marsh.

215
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,919
I did a few things with him
before I met you.

216
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,704
He's CIA.Hey, Barney, how you doing?

217
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,010
How you doing, Marsh?

218
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,098
How they hanging?

219
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,056
Gravity's setting in.

220
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,059
Welcome to the club.

221
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,148
As much as I would like
to exchange pleasantries
with you guys,

222
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,976
there's a pressing matter
at hand.

223
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,587
Meet Suharato Rahmat.

224
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,981
Former British national
turned arms dealer.

225
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,765
He has his own private army
and he's been hired

226
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,203
to steal some detonators
for nuclear missiles

227
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:18,161
for a very dangerous client.

228
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,947
Word on the street is
the client's name is Ocelot.

229
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,818
Hmm.

230
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:25,168
Now, those detonators
get in the hands of Ocelot,

231
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,910
he's planning on using them
to create
an international incident.

232
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,869
We can't let that happen.

233
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,611
So that's where
you guys come in.

234
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:36,919
Your landing zone is Qaddafi's
old chemical war plant
in Libya,

235
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,313
which I hear is very nice
this time of year.

236
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:42,838
Your mission is to make sure
the detonators stay there.

237
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,274
All right?

238
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,972
That's all I got.
Good luck.

239
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,799
Barney, keep 'em tucked.

240
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,105
I'll do my best.

241
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:54,415
- Operation Ocelot.
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,504
When were you gonna tell me?

243
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,245
When you stopped
playing footsies
with your girlfriend.

244
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,906
Hey, why's Christmas so pissed
about this Ocelot mission?

245
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,039
He's just being Christmas.

246
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,824
- Copy that.
He knows Barney very well.

247
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:16,306
He knows exactly how far
he's willing to go
to end Ocelot.

248
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,743
Who the hell
names himself Ocelot?

249
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,224
Years ago,
the CIA hired Barney

250
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:24,575
to find out
who code name "Ocelot"
actually is.

251
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:28,057
He was close
when somebody walked him
into an ambush

252
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,146
and nearly killed
his entire team.

253
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,235
Damn.

254
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,411
Yeah, some would say
Ocelot's a ghost

255
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:37,719
that Barney created
to cover his own ass
for a mistake.

256
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,286
No fucking way.

257
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,637
Ocelot exists and Barney
will bury him someday.

258
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,075
What the fuck happened
to your ear, man?

259
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,469
I'm glad you asked me that.

260
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:52,864
I wrestled in college.
Common affliction in that sport
is contusions to the ear.

261
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,867
Small pocket of blood
that separates the skin
from the cartilage.

262
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,705
Come on, big bird.

263
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,018
Get up there,
you deathtrap.

264
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,541
Don't insult it.

265
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:27,377
We have
a successful liftoff.

266
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,952
Maybe it was
my first ménage à trois.

267
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:40,303
You know. You know, Toll Road,
what I'm talking about, right?

268
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,480
Hey.

269
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,961
You know what is
a golden shower?

270
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,096
It's when the woman, she--

271
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:53,055
<i>she squats down on top of you
and releases her bladder.</i>

272
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,448
<i>It's very liberating.</i>

273
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,450
Wow, a world-class pervert.

274
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,104
You know what is
a golden shower?

275
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,367
You look like the type
who has had one before.

276
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,369
I'm cutting these losers.

277
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,981
- I heard too much of that.
- It's tune time.
Time for music.

278
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,637
It's ancient.

279
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,204
It's soothing.

280
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,727
- Soothing?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,685
Yeah, maybe.

282
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,862
You know I had
a panic attack last night.

283
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,343
Did you really?
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,953
Like your skin
starts to crawl?

285
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,999
- Your heart is beating?
- You know it.

286
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,480
Just take some Xanax
and pretend you're happy
with your life.

287
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,829
I am happy.

288
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,224
By the way,
you're the worst doctor, ever.

289
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,314
Maybe it's Gina
who's making you anxious.

290
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,881
She actually relaxes me.

291
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,101
It's this-- this-- The job.

292
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,842
No.

293
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,800
Some guys are just not meant
for companionship.

294
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,889
- Face the facts.
- Wrong.

295
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,718
Maybe you want to die
a bitter old sod,
but not me.

296
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,677
I want to be cheerful, happy.

297
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,942
But I will come visit you
in the home.

298
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,987
- Promise?
- Scout's honor.

299
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,296
Let's see
what's going on.

300
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:01,471
<i>One of them was covering me
in hot candle wax.</i>

301
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,472
Forget it.

302
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,524
Where are the detonators?

303
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,655
Never!

304
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,483
Your wife.

305
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,659
Not my wife.
No, <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

306
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,488
Your son is next.

307
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:21,317
P-Please, not my son. Please.

308
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,232
Give me the detonators,
and I'll make it quick.

309
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,712
My son, Adam...

310
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,540
This is a fact
you cannot change.

311
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,585
Give me the detonators or...

312
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:29,673
Not my son.

313
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:30,935
Your choice.

314
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,241
Okay. Okay.

315
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,591
They are in control room.

316
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,332
The code to the safe is...

317
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:39,466
eight,

318
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,554
one,

319
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,685
four,

320
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,773
two...

321
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,036
seven.

322
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,473
- Wise choice.

323
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,520
Let's wake up the kids.

324
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:52,609
- Ready?
- Yep.

325
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,183
<i>♪ East side ♪</i>

326
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,706
<i>♪ West♪ Side ♪</i>

327
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,717
Where'd that come from?

328
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,459
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

329
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,635
-  <i>LZ's hot.</i>
- Here we go.

330
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,509
- Incoming!
- Flak!

331
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,385
<i>Intel was off.</i>

332
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,647
Get creative!

333
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:31,909
Got it.

334
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,738
Touch and go.

335
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,218
Okay, rally up. Rally up.

336
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,828
- Am I driving lead?
- Nah.

337
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,352
Take Gunner to overwatch
and fall in.

338
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,274
Touch!

339
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,065
Happy hunting.

340
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,855
Check it out.
There's something happening
at the weapons plant.

341
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:05,813
We're on it.

342
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,429
<i>I count four vehicles
and a lot of ops.</i>

343
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,214
Well, let's make less of them.

344
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,788
Sir, I have a new transport.

345
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:25,876
Excellent.

346
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,183
Tell Ocelot we have them.

347
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,011
Let's go.

348
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,234
In position.

349
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,714
Load up!

350
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:39,150
<i>Rahmat's got the detonators.</i>

351
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,543
Gunner, you got eyes on them?

352
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,763
Like crystal in headlights.

353
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,119
Gunner, you're way off target.

354
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,512
What do you need,
a seeing-eye dog?

355
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,253
Damn spots.

356
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:00,650
Hey, Stevie Wonder,
you might want to
get that prescription checked.

357
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:05,829
<i>Heads up.
Lee, where are you?</i>

358
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,788
Looks like we're making
our entrance.

359
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,268
Hold on to your <i>huevos.</i>

360
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,748
Let's fly, baby!

361
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:21,541
Whoo-hoo!

362
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,764
Who the fuck is this now?

363
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,636
<i>What do we do, boss?</i>

364
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,942
Kill them.

365
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:33,596
Open fire!

366
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,087
Gunner, we could use some help!

367
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,049
Six months sober.

368
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,146
Now that's
what I'm talking about, Gunner.

369
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:05,976
Can you lose them?

370
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,684
- We're inside!
- Copy.

371
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,383
Split up.

372
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,038
Galan, we'll take point.

373
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,475
- You go after that squirter.
- Copy.

374
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:38,487
Ooh.

375
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,142
We lost the .50 cal.

376
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:56,679
Pull up alongside him.

377
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:00,553
Time to improvise.

378
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:01,771
I can improvise.

379
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,874
Gut shot. You'll live.

380
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,534
Whoa.

381
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:26,666
Maybe not.

382
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,851
Galan,
what the fuck are you doing?

383
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,766
I'm improvising.

384
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,302
What's going on in there?
I need a status report now!

385
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,437
One more and we're on Rahmat.

386
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,104
What the fuck, Easy?

387
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,196
Only easy day was yesterday.

388
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,197
Yep.

389
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,074
Initial success
or total failure?

390
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,780
Initial success.

391
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,391
I'm out of ammo.
I'm coming in.

392
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,313
You mean total failure.

393
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,888
Christmas, where are you?
The detonators are compromised.

394
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:00,716
<i>They're on the west side
heading north.</i>

395
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:05,634
Don't let Rahmat leave
with those detonators

396
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,723
or there's gonna be
a lot of dead people.

397
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,686
Get in, losers!
We're going shopping!

398
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,470
You might want
to watch your six!

399
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,779
Fire in the hole, fellas!

400
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,346
Moving!

401
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,220
Cover me!

402
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,004
Incoming!

403
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,531
Don't worry, my friend.
I would never leave you behind.

404
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:08,349
I can't get the angle!

405
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:19,012
<i>I'm out of flares.</i> Damn it, Barney!

406
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,885
Stay on mission, Christmas.

407
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,539
You're toast up there.

408
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,628
Listen to him, man.
Get the detonators.

409
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,804
<i>Get the detonators, Lee!</i>

410
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,153
That's an order!

411
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,767
Fuck no.
I'm saving your dumb ass!

412
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,527
You're welcome!

413
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,226
Nice work, man,
but who's on Rahmat?

414
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,252
Holy shit.

415
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,193
I miss him, man.

416
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,760

Everybody listen up.

424
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,743
There's an old expression.

425
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,528
Beware an old man

426
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,835
in a profession
where good men die young.

427
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:12,185
I'm sure Barney Ross has
had a seat reserved

428
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,796
at the big table up there
for some time now.

429
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,755
And he earned that seat.

430
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,148
He never stopped earning it.

431
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:22,935
He brought the best out
in each and every one of us
because he was the best of us.

432
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,374
To Barney.

433
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:28,723
To Barney.

434
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,039
How are you?

435
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,258
Great.

436
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,828
You don't gotta pretend, Lee.

437
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,962
You know Barney
wouldn't want to watch you
sulking like this.

438
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,007
It's true.

439
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,444
Can I help?

440
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,363
Well, since you're asking...

441
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:02,757
I'd like--

442
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,067
So when are we
going after the guys
that did this?

443
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,504
You ain't going nowhere.
You're done.

444
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,162
- What's that mean?
- You're off it.

445
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,294
- You're done. You're out.
- Bullshit, Marsh.

446
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:19,905
Who's gonna run
Barney's team?

447
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:25,693
Gina?

448
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,394
What is this,
a bad joke?

449
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:33,396
Well, you disobeyed
a direct order
from your superior

450
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,703
and that cost us the mission,
so you're out.

451
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,053
- I was trying to save him.
- Well, you didn't.

452
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,403
It's our play, it's our call.
You're out.

453
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:44,843
It was Barney's sacrifice
to make, brother.

454
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,715
Good death for the mission,
it would count.

455
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,543
And you just took it from him.

456
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,893
Made his sacrifice worthless.

457
00:30:58,639 --> 00:30:59,814
Christmas.

458
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,035
Yeah.

459
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,604
Thanks for the support.

460
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,262
You certainly picked
your moment, pal.

461
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,496
Oh.

462
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,194
Barney hated cover bands.

463
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:34,849
I'll be in touch.

464
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,895
Hey.

465
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,290
Nothing Barney did
was worthless.

466
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,553
You understand? Nothing!
Hey. Easy, cowboy.

467
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,207
Fuck you,
talking about Barney
in my face.

468
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,253
This ain't the place
or time.

469

<i>Por favor.</i>
Please, please. <i>Tranquilo.</i>

Hey, muscles.

00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:09,988
Not hold your sign.

486
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,557
You see anybody
looking to do me harm?

487
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,733
Potentially.

488
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:19,345
Whatever.
Just hold the sign.

489
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,174
"Potentially."
Double-O douchebag.

490
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,181
What's up, motherfuckers?

491
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,400
I'm here at my NOLA pad

492
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,489
live streaming to you at home.

493
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:35,187
Bringing a little
something-something

494
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,624
into your pathetic
little lives.

495
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,887
Look at these NOLA bitches.

496
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:45,110
Which one-- No, which two
am I gonna fuck after?

497
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,026
Oi. Have some respect
for the ladies.

498
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,245
I am live streaming here.

499
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:52,595
You guys believe this shit?
Look at this guy.

500
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:55,163
Who does this motherfucker
think he is?

501
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,383
"Oi, respect the ladies."

502
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,602
I'll respect them all right.

503
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,561
Respect them enough
to let them lick the sweat
off my balls.

504
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,434
Fuck, dude, my nose.

505
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,483
Do you know how much money
I make off this face, asshole?

506
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,078
Fuck it.

507
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:48,102
Welcome home, love.

508
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,800
You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

509
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,195
Probably.

510
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,979
Hey, do you read now?

511
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,807
What is this?

512
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,202
Going somewhere, are we?

513
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,378
We're going after the guy
that got Barney.

514
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,080
The only good thing
that came out of Barney's death
was the unsealing of that file.

515
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,344
What the fuck
does that mean?
What's in here?

516
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,955
Well,

517
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,131
Barney was part of
a classified operation

518
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,394
in between
international agencies.

519
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:23,485
And when it went south,
all the parties involved
decided to seal the file

520
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,575
until everyone
associated with it was dead.

521
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:29,839
So once Barney passed,
that file was declassified.

522
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,668
It gave us a vital clue
on Ocelot's identity.

523
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:38,370
I want in.
I'm coming with you.

524
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,675
Oh, I'm sorry.

525
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,591
You weren't invited.

526
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:44,245
Oh.

527
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,204
Well, won't you be lonely
without me?

528
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,815
No.

529
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,773
There's lots of other boys
on the mission.

530
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:51,861
Oh.

531
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:56,214
I'm not in the mood.

532
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,564
I'm gonna play
a little Hendrix.

533
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:01,001
- Usually does the trick.
- Don't start.

534
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,916
Oh, I'm starting.

535
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,878
- Oh, I always liked this tattoo.

536
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,532
So did your brother.

537
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:21,064
This was always my favorite seat
in the house.

538
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:23,806
Well, these
and the cheap seats.

539
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,381
You really need to be
- more careful.
- Mmm.

540
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,556
Make me.

541
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,478
Do an old soldier a favor.

542
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,308
First things first.

543
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,851
When I first met Barney...

544
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,464
I was straight out of the SAS.

545
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,990
Nothing to my name,
down on my luck.

546
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,259
He took a chance on me
when no one else would.

547
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:32,527
We're gonna get the guy
that did this to Barney.

548
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,531
I promise.

549
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:44,147
I know I can't go with you.

550
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,674
But I want you to take this.

551
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:57,900
Well,

552
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:01,469
I'll make sure
to give Rahmat your regards.

553
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,340
You catch any of that?

554
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,473
I don't know
what she's saying.

555
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:51,432
- But why do you think
they call her Lash?
- I have no idea.

556
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,348
But I'd love to find out.
She can lash me anytime.

557
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,873
Oh, it's way bigger
than that, darling.

558
00:39:57,873 --> 00:39:59,875
No, no.
That's the Chinese bird.

559
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,269
- We use the middle finger,
they use the pinky.
- Oh.

560
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,924
- But if the shoe fits...

561
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:07,579
I was saying
what's up with your ears?

562
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,276
- My ear?
- Oh, shit.

563
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,670
Well, everybody knows
I wrestled in college.

564
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,369
And a common affliction
in that sport is that you get
a contusion in the ear

565
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:18,764
that separates the cartilage
from the skin and
creates a little pocket.

566
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,548
I've had this one
drained nine times.

567
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:22,550
I've never seen him so quiet.

568
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,639
In essence, God gave me armor.

569
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,468
He hasn't said anything
since Barney died.

570
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,645
Now, I caught my roommate
talking shit about it one time.

571
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:33,953
And I had to smack him
upside his head and give him
his own cauliflower ear.

572
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,433
That's just the way it goes.

573
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,044
You want to feel it? No?

574
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,959
It's not contagious.
I promise.

575
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,452

578
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,653
How you doing, friend?

579
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,699
I'm looking for Decha.

580
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:30,139
Who?

581
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,708
Ex-Task Force 90.
Thailand Special Forces.

582
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,841
Supposedly owns a boat
that docks around here.

583
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,149
Don't know anyone around here
like that.

584
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,195
But if he have boat,

585
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:46,329
boat down there,
not up here.

586
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,203
Thanks for your help.

587
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,548
Hey, excuse me, friend.

588
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,159
You know the owner
of this boat?

589
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,815
I'm looking
for a man named Decha.

590
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:41,602
I'm sorry.
Decha has long gone.

591
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:43,473
Oh, yeah? Where?

592
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:47,695
To a place of peace.

593
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:49,523
Dead?

594
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:51,351
Ah.

595
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:55,529
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of that going around.

596
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,708
Excuse me.

597
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,319
I can't let you
steal this boat, sir.

598
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:05,713
What's it to you?

599
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:09,587
Just a boat.

600
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,937
It's not yours.

601
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,596
Hey, listen,
I'm taking this boat
with or without your permission.

602
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:26,168
Why do you have
Barney's ring?

603
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:28,910
Barney's dead.

604
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:33,828
And I need this boat
to get to the people
who killed him.

605
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:36,091
I was looking for Decha.

606
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:39,094
From what Barney said
about the man, I could
use him for what's ahead.

607
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:40,530
Barney's dead.

608
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,972
I was once Decha,
the man you seek.

609
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,627
But I put that man
behind me.

610
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,977
If what you say is true,

611
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:54,632
Barney should have
his revenge.

612
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,329
Damn right, he should.

613
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,035
Hey.

614
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:16,523
Okay, listen up.

615
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:20,701
The Thai cargo ship <i>Jintara</i>
was hijacked

616
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,138
in the Andaman Sea
by our mutual friend Rahmat.

617
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:25,271
The <i>Jintara</i>
has changed course

618
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:28,796
and is tracking en route
to the Russian coast
of Vladivostok.

619
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:31,843
Now, due to
that royal clusterfuck
that was Libya,

620
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:34,846
Rahmat has taken possession
of the nuclear detonators.

621
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:37,109
The ship itself
is gonna be hosting an exchange

622
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,068
where they'll
be taking possession of
the remaining nuclear materials

623
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:42,723
needed to construct
a viable bomb, nuclear type.

624
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,421
And we cannot let that happen.
Understood?

625
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:47,728
Now, we also have
valuable intel
that says

626
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:50,296
that Ocelot will be
on the <i>Jintara.</i>

627
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:54,213
So this might be
our one and only chance
to learn of his true identity.

628
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,954
- Or her.
- What's that?

629
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,043
Could be a her.

630
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,350
Or her identity, yes.

631
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,135
And bring him or her in.

632
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:05,572
As you know, Barney's death
opened up a file

633
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:08,053
that reveals the name
of a man who worked
with Ocelot.

634
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:10,142
A witness
in witness protection.

635
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:11,752
More on him from Russo.

636
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:15,016
Name's Phen Lyong Bai.

637
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:18,150
Ocelot's former partner
who'd love to rat Ocelot out.

638
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,760
Snitches get stitches.
Right, Gunner?

639
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,762
That's right.
Snitches get stitches.

640
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:24,547
I don't have to tell you
how sensitive
this mission is.

641
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:29,335
If the Russians get wind
that the US forces
are not only near

642
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:31,076
but inside
Russian territory,

643
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:32,947
it's a World War III
shit show.

644
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:35,297
Understood?

645
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,169
So that's why
this mission carries
no US signature whatsoever.

646
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:39,127
Full deniability.

647
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,695
If this goes bad, it's on you.
And one last thing.

648
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:45,394
Since you Neanderthals
dicked up that last mission
in Libya without me,

649
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:48,746
I'm gonna be coming along
to babysit you this time.

650
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,270
Now, won't that be fun?
Gina.

651
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:55,404
All right, so the mission's
gonna go down like this.

652
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:58,799
We're gonna run this assault
as a split team
with two separate objectives.

653
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,322
We're gonna HALO in.

654
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:01,802
Team Alpha's
gonna secure the bridge

655
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,804
while Bravo searches
and sweeps the boat.

656
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,764
We're gonna identify,
kill-capture
both Ocelot and Rahmat,

657
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,419
secure the detonators
and the nuclear components,
helo extract.

658
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:11,856
Any questions?

659
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:18,166
Is my delivery
a little different
than Barney's?

660
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,560
He probably
would have just said,
"Let's go."

661
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,822
Yeah.

662
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:22,954
Well...

663
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,869
let's go.

664
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:33,878
Is that an axe?

665
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:36,619
No, it's a snow shovel.

666
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:41,059
That makes sense.
Not for humanity,
but for you it makes sense.

667
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:49,371
Hey. So what's your story?

668
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,767
Barney told me
you were ex-Task Force 90.

669
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,856
Ultimate killer type.

670
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,032
Never seen anyone faster
or better.

671
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:04,082
There's only so many times
you can kill a man, Christmas.

672
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,736
Each time,

673
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:09,000
it gets easier.

674
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,179
You become numb to pain,
to joy, and to love.

675
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:18,270
With every person you kill,

676
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,839
you lose
a little more of yourself.

677
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:26,800
I had to stop
before there was nothing left.

678
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,969
Figured I'd be
using my axe by now.

679
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:56,759
This is too quiet.
Something ain't right.

680
00:48:56,759 --> 00:49:00,763
Easy Day, Lash, you're with me.
The rest of you,
swing around port quarter.

681
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:03,027
Where's port quarter again?

682
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:06,639
I was Army.
We said left and right,
not port and starship shit.

683
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,075
Starboard is right.

684
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:11,383
Port, left. Quarter, back.

685
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,906
- Got it.
- Let's move.

686
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:48,159
Got a bad feeling about this.

687
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:50,639
Yeah,
where the hell is everybody?

688
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,815
The nuke
is definitely onboard.

689
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,603
<i>All right, listen up.
Bad news.</i>

690
00:49:57,603 --> 00:50:00,084
<i>They already have uranium
with the detonators.</i>

691
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:03,609
<i>There is now
an active nuclear bomb
on the ship.</i>

692
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,829
We're about to
take the bridge.

693
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,886
It's a ghost town in here.

694
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,715
- Go!
- Put your weapons down now!

695
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,592
What a fucking mess
this turned out to be.

696
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,030
First Libya,
now this.

697
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,119
Somebody knew we were coming.
Both times.

698
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,772
My intel was solid.

699
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,687
- Your intel was shit.
- Ah, shit on this.

700
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,341
The intel
could have been leaked.

701
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:42,735
- We don't know you.
- He was verified.

702
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,954
Well, then maybe it was
your new girlfriend.

703
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:46,434
Fuck you, Gunner.

704
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:49,176
You sold us out in Vilena
on that mission.

705
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:51,091
Think I'd forget about that?

706
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,050
Somebody did
sell us out.

707
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,313
How about your man?

708
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:57,576
You sold him out
so you could be on top.

709
00:50:57,576 --> 00:50:59,404
Back off.
She wouldn't do that.

710
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:01,406
What? Fuck him on top?

711
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:02,972
Fuck you.

712
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,670
Maybe it's the mute
over in the corner.

713
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,586
What's up, Galan?
Cat got your tongue, cowboy?

714
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:10,023
Yeah, he's hiding something.
Yeah.

715
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:12,373
- I never trusted
this fucking guy.

716
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:26,387
Who's the leader?
I'm the leader.

717
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,104
Take him.

718
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,601
Fuck.

719
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,430
There she is.

720
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,565
Go time.

721
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:20,354
I'll go first.

722
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:22,051
Send down a signal
when it's clear
for you to follow.

723
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,792
This is as far as I go.

724
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,579
- I could use you.
- I can't.

725
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:31,017
If I let the old me out,

726
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:34,412
I don't know if I could ever
get him back in.

727
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:41,288
I understand.

728
00:53:40,347 --> 00:53:42,175
Should be carnage up here.

729
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,525
Where are you guys?

730
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:48,660
My shift's done.
Going downstairs.

731
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:07,331
Don't move
and turn around.

732
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,158
Slowly.

733
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:10,812
Well, which one is it, friend?

734
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:13,554
Don't move
or turn around slowly?

735
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:15,948
Turn around.

736
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,036
Very slowly.

737
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:24,435
Ah! Jesus Christ!

738
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:27,264
Colin, you scared
the shit out of me,
you bellend.

739
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,483
Colin?
Who the fuck is Colin?

740
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:32,791
Don't give me that.
Hey, you need to be
careful with that.

741
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,836
That could go off
in your hand.

742
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,287
Perfect timing,
Mr. Marsh.

743
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,379
<i>Marsh?</i>

744
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,250
This mission was a trap.

745
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,078
Somebody leaked our intel.

746
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,302
<i>My demands are simple.</i>

747
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,130
<i>Prisoner exchange.</i>

748
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,090
<i>I want your prisoner,
Phen Lyong Bai.</i>

749
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,266
A dear friend of a friend.

750
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:14,311
If not,

751
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,837
Mr. Marsh will be the example
of how deadly serious I am.

752
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:22,231
So, what's it going to be,
Russo?

753
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:24,756
I don't have the authority.

754
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,192
I know you don't!

755
00:55:27,106 --> 00:55:30,152
But I know someone who does.

756
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:44,819
Let's get the last
of the fake planes up.

757
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:50,172
<i>♪ And the rocket's
Red glare ♪</i>

758
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:53,350
<i>♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪</i>

759
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,363
Rahmat,

760
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:08,974
you sneaky little sausage.

761
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:16,590
I can get you the authority.

762
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,071
<i>Phen Lyong Bai
is in your lockup.</i>

763
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:25,033
<i>Your contact is Donald Allman,
authorization 2-2-5-7-9.</i>

764
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:27,296
<i>Good.</i>

765
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,820
<i>And no funny business.</i>

766
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,604
It's your call
whether the Expendables

767
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:33,041
need to live up
to their namesake or not.

768
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:25,180
<i>Bringing a little
something-something</i>

769
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,618
<i>into your
pathetic little lives.</i>

770
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:30,055
<i>Look at these bitches.</i>

771
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:35,103
<i>Which one-- No, which two
am I gonna fuck after?</i>

772
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:37,758
<i>Oi.
Have some respect
for the ladies.</i>

773
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,021
<i>I am live streaming here.</i>

774
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:42,197
<i>You guys believe this shit?
Look at this guy.</i>

775
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:47,507
<i>"...the ladies."</i>

776
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,161
<i>I'll respect them all right.</i>

777
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:50,292
<i>Respect them enough
to let them lick</i>

778
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:51,337
<i>the sweat off my balls.</i>

779
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:19,496
Huh.
This doesn't belong to you.

780
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,065
Where are my friends?

781
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,810
- Where are my friends?
- Mm-mmm.

782
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,769
Sir, we might have a problem.

783
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:34,206
Paithoon and Takk
have gone dark.

784
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:39,167
Room 657, B-deck.

785
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:40,560
Much appreciated.

786
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:43,258
Ah.

787
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:47,698
Gunner.

788
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:50,352
<i>Takk?</i> Don't mind if I do.

789
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:53,921
<i>Report back, Takk.
We may have a rat onboard.</i>

790
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:55,923
<i>Check everyone's status.</i>

791
00:58:57,142 --> 00:58:58,578
<i>Takk?</i>

792
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,449
Takk can't come
to the phone right now.

793
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:03,104
He's a little limp.

794
00:59:06,064 --> 00:59:08,196
Who is this?

795
00:59:08,196 --> 00:59:11,112
<i>A man who made a mistake
letting you live.</i>

796
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:14,159
But I'm here to remedy that.
<i>Ah.</i>

797
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:16,944
Look who's still
trying to be a hero.

798
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:19,599
<i>How nice of you
to come aboard.</i>

799
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,950
<i>If you're hoping for
a redo of the mess in Libya,
you're too late, I'm afraid.</i>

800
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,300
My men are on their way
to hunt you down.

801
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,956
<i>So I guess it's up to me
to put you in an early grave.</i>

802
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:32,569
Just like I did your friend
in Libya.

803
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,529
Correction.
He wasn't my friend.

804
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:38,662
He was my brother.

805
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,489
So you can bring your army.

806
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:42,579
<i>Bring all the fucking men
you want</i>

807
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,232
<i>and I'll work through
every last one of them.</i>

808
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,365
<i>When I get to you,</i>

809
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:48,323
I'll make sure
that the only way
you leave this ship

810
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:50,978
is in a wonderful variety
of pieces.

811
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,544
Don't shoot by the bomb!

812
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,701
Pavel,
you have eyes on the rat?

813
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,529
<i>Yes, sir.</i> Location?

814
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:48,966
<i>Corridor, deck one.</i>

815
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:56,625
<i>Deck two.</i> What?

816
01:02:12,685 --> 01:02:14,774
<i>Officers' dining area,
deck three.</i>

817
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:57,616
Rubber side down, mate.

818
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,759
He's on the stern.

819
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:03,638
What are you doing?

820
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,858
Thought you were done
with this life.

821
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:09,470
It would be disrespectful
to Barney's memory
to let his friend die.

822
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,212
I like the look.

823
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,692
Thank you.

824
01:05:13,692 --> 01:05:15,999
- Then let's get to it.
- Okay.

825
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:42,808
Everything's sealed tight
down here.

826
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,549
Yeah, these are
welded up solid too.

827
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:45,724
Okay, so what's next?

828
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:47,465
Bilge system.

829
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,728
- What?
- Bilge system.

830
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:53,253
In emergencies,
it clears water
from the ship's dry areas.

831
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:55,342
If you get it open,
it should let us out of here.

832
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:57,779
Come on, man.
Let's get
this fucking thing open.

833
01:05:57,779 --> 01:05:59,738
Damn it.

834
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:05,135
- Well, that ain't budging.
- No shit. It's got to get wet.

835
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:06,701
What?

836
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,399
Wet. If it gets wet,
it'll open.

837
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:12,925
Well, anybody gotta pee?
I gotta go.

838
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:15,884
I've had to piss
since we HALO'd in here.

839
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,504
A little privacy, please?

840
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,863
The hyoid bone.

841
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:43,086
It's the only bone
in the human body
not connected to any others.

842
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:47,568
It's right here in the throat.
Without it, we cannot speak.

843
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,137
With these hands,
I will claw the hyoid bone

844
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,139
from the throat
of that fucker Rahmat,

845
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:54,880
stick it up
his boyfriend's <i>culo,</i>

846
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,751
then make both
of their asses apologize

847
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,015
while they drown
in their own blood.

848
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,278
Barney was my hero.

849
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:03,497
I do not speak,
I cannot speak,

850
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:07,849
because my mind is full
of these brutal,
visceral fantasies,

851
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:11,592
fantasies that will now
become a hellish reality.

852
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,902
You should go back
to not talking.

853
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,653
- Done.
- Any takers?

854
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:31,525
This will lead us
to the men
who killed Barney?

855
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:34,050
Uh, yes.

856
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,312
I will avenge him.

857
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:44,625
Guess he does
like golden showers.

858
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:48,281
Lyong Bai is en route to you
as we speak.

859
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:52,459
<i>I expect to have my team
returned alive.</i>

860
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:55,201
Of course.
For what is a man
without his word?

861
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:57,638
- Prepare for exchange.

862
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,162
Moving out!

863
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:03,079
- This way.
- Okay.

864
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,472
Your friends
will be really happy
to see you, right?

865
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:07,083
Probably not.

866
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,172
Gina will have to admit
she needs me.

867
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,347
- On three.
- Yeah.

868
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:11,435
Three.

869
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:15,134
Nobody here.

870
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:16,701
No shit.

871
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:17,789
Where did they go?

872
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:21,923
You smell piss?

873
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:24,012
Yeah.

874
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:28,539
We're gonna stay quiet
until it's time to get loud.

875
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:30,541
Okay, okay. Yeah.

876
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:36,286
Get on the ground!

877
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:38,984
Time to get loud?

878
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,990
It's you
who needs to get down
on the ground, pal.

879
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:46,905
Or what?

880
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,216
Or get wasted
by an Expendable.

881
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:57,481
Don't tell me.
You're happy to see me.

882
01:08:57,481 --> 01:09:00,658
Technically, you're not
an Expendable anymore, Christmas.

883
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:02,181
Especially you.

884
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:04,444
- Such a pleasure.
- Likewise.

885
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,054
- Great timing.
- Easy Day.

886
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:07,360
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

887
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:11,234
Is that my Traumahawk?

888
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,105
- Yeah.
- How do you like it?

889
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:15,194
Growing on me.
What took you so long?

890
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,762
Did you think
that I was gonna believe

891
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:20,199
you were actually
just gifting me your knife?

892
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,201
You gifted her
your knife?

893
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:24,116
And they say
romance is dead.

894
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:27,206
He put a tracker in it.
It was all part of the plan.

895
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:29,426
- Sorry.

896
01:09:30,514 --> 01:09:32,255
I feel a little used.

897
01:09:39,087 --> 01:09:41,046
Okay, let's go.

898
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:42,917
Hey, Gunner,
watch our six.

899
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:44,876
I like your hair.

900
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:46,834
- Who's your new friend?
- Decha.

901
01:09:46,834 --> 01:09:49,707
Old friend of Barney's.
Kicks ass
with the best of them.

902
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:51,578
Any friend of Barney's
is all right by me.

903
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:54,973
- Rahmat took Marsh.
- Huh. I'm devastated.

904
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:59,151
First things first.
Toll Road, I need you
to take a look at something.

905
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,895
It's a big fucking bomb.

906
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:05,853
With the detonators
that we didn't get.

907
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:07,986
We're fucked.

908
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:09,683
Can you elaborate?

909
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:11,729
This thing's wired
to go in 27 minutes.

910
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:14,427
It's tamperproof.
Got mercury switches.

911
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:17,561
The only way we're shutting
this bad boy down is to find
the remote kill switch.

912
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:18,866
That's the last line
of defense.

913
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:20,825
Now, it's short range,

914
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:23,131
so whoever has that
on their person
is on this fucking boat.

915
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:24,263
Rahmat.
Rahmat.

916
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:26,831
Who's Rahmat?

917
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:28,441
Guy who killed Barney.

918
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:31,183
We probably
just entered Russian waters.

919
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:33,620
Dressing this ship to look like
a US aircraft carrier

920
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,319
with a primed nuke
about to blow
off the coast of Russia.

921
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:37,755
It's going
to start World War III.

922
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:40,671
Clock is ticking.
Let's lock and load.

923
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:42,934
New location, deckside.

924
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:45,415
It's all about
this kill switch now.

925
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:48,069
Switch off Rahmat permanently.

926
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:51,203
Well, can you make us
something loud and messy?

927
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,510
Does the pope shit
in the woods?

928
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,599
No, the pope don't shit
in the woods.

929
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:58,123
Or next to a bear.
Why you gotta say shit
like that?

930
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:02,345
<i>♪ I don't know

931

Shit!

941
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:49,060
Fuck it!

942
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,591
- You're welcome.
- Huh.

943
01:13:01,812 --> 01:13:02,813
Don't mention it.

944
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:14,128
Good to be back.

945
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:19,395
I got you.

946
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:21,788
Thanks.

947
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:42,635
Hey, <i>puta.</i>

948
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:00,914
I got him.

949
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,890
Toll Road!

950
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,632
Easy! Man down! Man down!

951
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:30,422
Can you kiss that
and make it better?

952
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,903
Maybe later.
I'm a little busy right now.

953
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,731
I got him.

954
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,479
Hey!

955
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,472
<i>Ready for prisoner exchange.</i>

956
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:22,387
<i>Three minutes
until we touch down.</i>

957
01:15:22,387 --> 01:15:24,171
Standing by for the exchange.

958
01:15:24,171 --> 01:15:25,782
<i>Proceed as planned.</i>

959
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:49,370
How you doing, Rahmat?

960
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:54,027
I see you like
- to play with knives.
- Well, I ain't playing no more.

961
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:57,030
You're gonna give me
the kill switch,
and we're gonna end all this.

962
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,684
Come and get it, hero.

963
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:13,367
Is that the biggest one
you've got?

964
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:41,744
Nah.

965
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:43,920
That's the biggest one
I got.

966
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:52,102
Lee, you good?

967
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:53,190
Yeah.

968
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,632
Where's the kill switch?

969
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:03,722
You fucking idiot.
I don't have the kill switch.

970
01:18:05,202 --> 01:18:06,856
My boss has it.

971
01:18:08,553 --> 01:18:10,729
Ocelot.

972
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,401
Phen Lyong Bai is here.

973
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:32,925
He's our witness
that can identify Ocelot.

974
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:43,893
- Hello, Bai.
- Oh, my God, no.

975
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:45,459
- No!
- Bye-bye, Bai.

976
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:54,991
Marsh is Ocelot.

977
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:56,514
He's had the kill switch
this whole--

978
01:18:58,951 --> 01:19:00,953
That's for Barney.

979
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:10,615
How long until detonation?

980
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:12,443
Twelve minutes.

981
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:14,227
All right, we got 12 minutes

982
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,142
before this ship blows up
like a Roman candl--

983
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:30,243
Hey, Marsh.
I guess you won't be needing
that anymore.

984
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:32,158
All right, Christmas!

985
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:34,334
You're like genital warts!

986
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:38,164
Always showing up
where you're not wanted
and refusing to go away!

987
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:40,253
You got something I need, Marsh.

988
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:43,256
I'm coming down to get it.

989
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:46,607
I guess you figured out
that this device right here

990
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:49,132
is the only thing
preventing World War III,

991
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:51,961
a conflict that,
while devastating for many,

992
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,963
it'll be insanely,

993
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:55,486
insanely,

994
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:58,054
insanely profitable
for somebody.

995
01:19:58,054 --> 01:20:00,404
And that somebody
is gonna be me.

996
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:03,842
And the Expendables
will take all the blame!

997
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,713
So, enjoy the show!

998
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:10,849
Kill them all!

999
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:11,850
Take cover!

1000
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,072
Everybody get down!

1001
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,556
We need to get clear
of this boat
or we're all gonna get fried!

1002
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:25,168
Jumping overboard
is seeming like
a decent plan right now.

1003
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:28,127
We'll never make it out
of the blast zone.
We'll never make it in time.

1004
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,742
- Hey, man, you're not
going down on my watch.

1005
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:38,311
We gotta move.
He's bleeding out.

1006
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:40,879
I got an idea.

1007
01:20:40,879 --> 01:20:43,926
We can take my boat.
It's being towed.

1008
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:45,492
That's a great idea.

1009
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:46,885
Next time,
let's start with that!

1010
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:48,844
Yeah!

1011
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,323
Gunner, give us cover fire.
We're on the way out.

1012
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:52,369
Copy that.
Cover fire.

1013
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,768
Meet at the stern.
Repeat, meet at the stern.

1014
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:09,168
- We gotta move!

1015
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,042
I saw them go
to the other side.

1016
01:21:30,276 --> 01:21:33,018
There's no one on the bridge.
Start searching the ship.

1017
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,900
Toll Road, you're next.

1018
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:56,650
Galan, you're up.

1019
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:14,755
What?

1020
01:22:17,758 --> 01:22:18,803
Never mind.

1021
01:22:19,499 --> 01:22:21,588
Let's go.

1022
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:40,651
Mission first!

1023
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:49,138
I gotta turn this ship around.

1024
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:55,405
Make my sacrifice count!

1025
01:22:57,624 --> 01:22:59,496
It's his decision to make.

1026
01:23:05,806 --> 01:23:09,245
Decha, we need to move
or Toll Road's
not gonna make it.

1027
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:22,780
Check in block-D
then go around.

1028
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:10,105
Get the rest of
the inflatable boats up here.

1029
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,150
Sir,
we're headed back out to sea.

1030
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:14,326
Move it,
move it, move it, people!

1031
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,725
Genital fucking warts.

1032
01:25:21,725 --> 01:25:22,943
Take him out!

1033
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:25,859
Get that RIB inflated!

1034
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:30,299
We need to get the ship
back on course.

1035
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:31,865
Get up to the bridge
and fix this.

1036
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:32,910
But, sir...

1037
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,347
But, sir, what?

1038
01:25:35,347 --> 01:25:36,827
The nuke is gonna blow.
We can't go up--

1039
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:42,224
How do you feel
about a promotion?

1040
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:44,791
All to the bridge!

1041
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:48,099
Take him down!
All to the bridge! Go, go!

1042
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:50,857
Looks like I'll be
seeing you soon, Barney.

1043
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:16,579
Christmas!

1044
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:27,590
Right here, Marsh.

1045
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,767
Ho ho ho! I see you
called in the cavalry!

1046
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:33,378
Well, you can't
get rid of me.

1047
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:35,946
Well, the fun's in trying.

1048
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:38,296
Why don't you come down
face-to-face?

1049
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:40,167
Man-to-man.

1050
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:42,779
Huh.

1051
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:44,433
Old school.

1052
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:45,651
Don't mind if I do.

1053
01:27:46,652 --> 01:27:48,306
Can't wait.

1054
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:50,395
Don't you fucking move!
I'll be right down.

1055
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:57,315
Barney tried
to expose me 25 years ago,
and he failed.

1056
01:27:57,315 --> 01:28:00,100
But you,
you're a good soldier.

1057
01:28:00,927 --> 01:28:02,538
You're a very good soldier.

1058
01:28:02,538 --> 01:28:05,628
But this, I mean,
this is above and beyond.

1059
01:28:05,628 --> 01:28:08,239
This--
This is next level.

1060
01:28:09,849 --> 01:28:11,764
Barney would be
proud of you.

1061
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,290
Well,
you can tell him yourself.

1062
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,857
Because you're
about to join him.

1063
01:28:17,857 --> 01:28:20,295
So very nice.

1064
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,948
Look what Santa
brought me.

1065
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:35,745
The fuck?

1066
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:37,050
Barney?

1067
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:39,662
Hey, I had him
with the classics!

1068
01:28:39,662 --> 01:28:42,273
You almost fucking killed me!

1069
01:28:42,273 --> 01:28:43,753
You're welcome.

1070
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:48,235
Come on!

1071
01:28:49,933 --> 01:28:51,326
The fuck is happening?

1072
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,370
Hold on!

1073
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:00,073
- Where are the nukes?
- In the stern.

1074
01:29:02,249 --> 01:29:04,861
Hey, you were dead!

1075
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:06,863
- The hell's going on?
- I'm a little busy.

1076
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,111
So what's the story?

1077
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:40,200
Twenty-five years ago,
we were doing a covert op,

1078
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,159
and eight of my team
got wiped out.

1079
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:45,815
I had to fake my own death
to open up a classified file,

1080
01:29:45,815 --> 01:29:49,514
driving Marsh out of hiding
so I could prove he's Ocelot.

1081
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:51,473
Why'd you keep it from us?

1082
01:29:51,473 --> 01:29:53,300
If I didn't take that job,
they'd all be alive.

1083
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,564
So, it was personal.

1084
01:29:56,478 --> 01:29:58,393
You understand.

1085
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,035
Whew.

1086
01:30:32,818 --> 01:30:34,298
I need a drink.

1087
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:35,995
Me too.

1088
01:30:37,649 --> 01:30:39,564
- You're buying.
- I'm broke.

1089
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:42,088
- You were funnier
when you were dead.

1090
01:30:44,613 --> 01:30:47,006
Great spending time
with you again.

1091
01:30:47,006 --> 01:30:48,573
But you could use a shower.

1092
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,460
Toll Road,
you owe me 20 bucks.

1093
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,678
Guess you won't
be needing glasses.

1094
01:31:06,678 --> 01:31:07,940
Not bad.

1095
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,507
Hey.

1096
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:14,077
Salute to my friends
who never quit.

1097
01:31:14,077 --> 01:31:15,470
Cheers to you all.

1098
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,471
<i>Salud.</i> Salute.

1099
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,734
To you guys.

1100
01:31:18,734 --> 01:31:21,301
What about that corny quote
on the ship, Christmas?

1101
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:24,957
- You don't need to
repeat that, Toll Road.
-"Make my sacrifice count!"

1102
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:26,916
Yeah, fuck you.

1103
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:28,657
Stop giving him
such a hard time.

1104
01:31:28,657 --> 01:31:30,441
I think it's sweet.

1105
01:31:30,441 --> 01:31:32,574
- Aw.
- That's sweet.

1106
01:31:32,574 --> 01:31:35,533
They're all just jealous
because you're
the most handsome one.

1107
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:36,665
I know.

1108
01:31:36,665 --> 01:31:38,318
Ain't love beautiful?

1109
01:31:38,318 --> 01:31:40,495
Hey, Toll Road.

1110
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:42,540
Really?

1111
01:31:43,585 --> 01:31:44,977
Ah.

1112
01:31:44,977 --> 01:31:47,458
Barney Ross,
back from the dead.

1113
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:51,288
Only you could walk away
from a blazing inferno
with not a scratch on you.

1114
01:31:51,288 --> 01:31:54,421
You are like a mythical bird
raising up from the ashes.

1115
01:31:54,421 --> 01:31:56,423
I don't know
- how you do it.
- Just a moment.

1116
01:31:56,423 --> 01:31:58,425
I am relaxed. I'm trying
to talk to my hero over here.

1117
01:31:58,425 --> 01:32:00,253
Would you give me some space
please, Easy Day?

1118
01:32:00,253 --> 01:32:03,126
Hey, lame brain,
you got a minute?

1119
01:32:03,126 --> 01:32:04,954
- Of course.
- A minor question.

1120
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:06,433
Step right in.

1121
01:32:06,433 --> 01:32:08,566
- There it is. Piece of junk.
- Ah.

1122
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:09,654
I missed this.

1123
01:32:09,654 --> 01:32:11,351
- Thanks, my friend.
- Yeah.

1124
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:15,094
- I need to know.
- Who the corpse is?

1125
01:32:15,094 --> 01:32:16,748
Exactly.

1126
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:19,446
You ever wonder
what happened
to Jumbo Shrimp?

01:32:39,118 --> 01:32:40,163

Oh, yes, I did.
